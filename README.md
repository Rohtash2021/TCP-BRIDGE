# TCP-client-server-implementation

-> Utilizes socket programming in C to create a TCP client-server architecture.

-> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable and ordered data transfer between the client and server.

-> Implements separate source files for the TCP server and client for modularity and clarity.

-> Demonstrates the establishment of a TCP connection between the client and server for bidirectional data exchange.

-> Utilizes standard C libraries, including <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <unistd.h>, and <arpa/inet.h>.

-> Presents error handling mechanisms for smooth operation and effective exception handling.

-> Provides a reliable communication model for real-time applications and data-intensive services.

-> Serves as a foundation for understanding TCP, socket programming, and network-based projects.
